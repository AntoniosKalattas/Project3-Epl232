1. stack.h -> 2. stack.c
NODE and STACK structs
push, pop, createStack, and freeStack functions.

3. file.h -> 4. file.c
Implement all stack-related operations,(nodes w/ game states and managing memory)
Declare file reading & game board setup functions

5. solver.h -> 6. solver.c
Implement functions to read the game state from a file and return a 2D array w/ the boardâ€™s initial state
Declare backtracking solver functions

7. main.c
Implement backtracking logic, including the function that uses push and pop to manage stack states.
Track moves (push/pop count) and apply the game constraints.
duties of main:
1)Reads arguments and initializes the game board.
2)Calls the solver.
3)Outputs the board and cleanup.

8. printer.c and printer.h  may not be needed to be done seperately, we ll see
